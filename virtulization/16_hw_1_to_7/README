Question 1. Compute the response time and turnaround time when running three 
jobs of length 200 with the SJF and FIFO schedulers.


J1 = 200
J2 = 200
J3 = 200


SJF:
====

         J1         J2          J3     
    |__________|___________|____________|____
    0         200         400          600


J1  :   Response time   :   0
    :   Turnadound time :   200

J2  :   Response Time   :   200
    :   Turnaround Time :   400

J3  :   Response Time   :   400
    :   Turnaround Time :   600


FIFO:
====

         J1         J2          J3     
    |__________|___________|____________|____
    0         200         400          600


J1  :   Response time   :   0
    :   Turnadound time :   200

J2  :   Response Time   :   200
    :   Turnaround Time :   400

J3  :   Response Time   :   400
    :   Turnaround Time :   600


Result :
========

If the lenghts of each job are same, then both FIFO and SJF gives same response 
and turnaround times.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================

Question 2. Now, do the same buth with jobs of different lenghts: 100, 200 and 
300.

J1 = 100
J2 = 200
J3 = 300


SJF:
====

       J1     J2          J3     
    |_____|_________|______________|_________ Time-->
    0     100       300            600


J1  :   Response time   :   0
    :   Turnadound time :   100

J2  :   Response Time   :   100
    :   Turnaround Time :   300

J3  :   Response Time   :   300
    :   Turnaround Time :   600


FIFO:
=====

Assuming that J1 came just a slight before J2 and J2 came just a slight 
before J3.

       J1     J2          J3     
    |____|_________|______________|________  Time-->
    0    100       300            600


J1  :   Response time   :   0
    :   Turnadound time :   100

J2  :   Response Time   :   100
    :   Turnaround Time :   300

J3  :   Response Time   :   300
    :   Turnaround Time :   600

Question 3 : Now, do the same, buth also with RR Scheduler and a time slice of 
1.

J1 = 2
J2 = 3
J3 = 4

RR (time slice : 1):

   
      J1   J2   J3   J1   J2   J3   J2   J3   J3
    |____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____  Time-->
    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8   9


J1  :   Response time   :   0
    :   Turnadound time :   4

J2  :   Response Time   :   1
    :   Turnaround Time :   7

J3  :   Response Time   :   2
    :   Turnaround Time :   9

===============================================================================

Question 4: For waht types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround 
times as FIFO?


Answer : If the lenghts of each job are same, then both FIFO and SJF gives same 
response and turnaround times.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================

Question 5 : For what types of workloads and quantum lenghts does SJF deliver 
the same response time as RR?

Answer : if the size of each job is same as quantum length of RR schduling, 
then each job will have same respone time.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================

Question 6 : What happens to response time with SJF as job lenghts increase?
Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

Below are the output of average response time with increase in the job lengths.
Job length is the maximum lenths from the provided job lengths for an execution.

Job length  : Response time
    4       :   1.67
    8       :   3
    12      :   4.33
    16      :   5.33
    20      :   6.67
    24      :   8
    27      :   9.93
    31      :   10.33
    35      :   11.67
    39      :   13
    43      :   14.67

It clearly shows that with increase in the job length, Response time also 
increases. But the change is very less compare to the change in job sizes.

RR scheduling has better response time for the same samples, but the trunaound 
time becomes more with RR.

===============================================================================
===============================================================================

Question 7: What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increse?
Can  you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, Given N 
jobs ?

Answer : With Quantum lengths increse, the response time jobs with decrease as 
CPU will be used by a process for long time.

Below equation can provide the worst case response time.

If the number of jobs are : N
and the size of quantum is : q

The the worst case response time will be : (N-1) * q

The considerations for this equation is as below:
    (i) suppose, all the jobs have length greater than quantum size of RR.
    (ii) The last job to get the response from CPU, will get it once all 'N-1'
         jobs have run for the quantum time(q) each.


For example,

We have 5 jobs with job lengths as :

Job1 : 3
Job2 : 6
Job3 : 10
Job4 : 15

and response time is : 2

The Job4 will get the response after all jobs(Job1, Job2, Job3 have executed 
for 2 time unit each.

then 2+2+2 = 6, Job4 will start at 6.

we get the same result from the formula:

worst response time = (N - 1) * q
                    
                    = (4 - 1) * 2 = 6
