Summary:                                                                         
========

Sometimes, as it turns out, it is quite useful for a parent to wait for a child 
process to finish what it has been doing. This task is accomplished with the 
wait() system call (or its complete sibling waitpid()).

Compilation:                                                                     
============

[ ] gcc p2.c -o p

Execution:                                                                       
==========

[ ] ./p2

output:

Hello, world (pid : 73923)
Hello, I am child (pid : 73924)
Hello, I am parent of 73924 (wc : 73924) (pid : 73923)

Explanation:                                                                     
============

The parent process calls wait() to delay its execution until the child finishes 
executing. When the child is done, wait() returns to the parent.

Adding a wait() call to the code makes the output deterministic.
