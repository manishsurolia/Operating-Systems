Write another program using fork(). The child process should print "Hello"; the 
parent process should print "goodbye". You should try to ensure that the child 
process always prints first; can you do this without calling wait() in the 
parent?

Yes, by adding sleep() in the parent process, it will always execute child first

[ ] gcc 9_hw.c -o 9_hw


[ ] ./9_hw
Hello, I am child process. (pid : 6982)
Goodbye, I am parent process. (pid: 6981)
