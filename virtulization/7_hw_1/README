Problem:
========

Write a program that calls fork(). Before calling fork(), have the main process 
access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to some thing(e.g., 100).
What value is the variable in the child process?
what happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of 
x?

Both process have its own copy of variable, x, so  increments  by both the 
procesesses does not have change each other value of x.
