Now write a program that uses wait() to wait for the child process
to finish in the parent. What does wait() return? What happens if
you use wait() in the child?


[ ] gcc 11_hw.c -o 11_hw
[ ] ./11_hw 
Hello, I am child. I will call execv to launch ls command

Hello, I am parent.


There is no impact of adding wait() in the child process.
