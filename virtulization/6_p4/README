Explanation:                                                                     
============

When p4 is run, it looks as if nothing has happened, the shell just prints the 
command prompt and is immediatly ready for your next command.

However, that is not the case; the program p4 did indeed call fork() to create a
 new child, and then run the wc program via a call to execvp().

You don't see any output printed to the screeen because it has been redirected 
to the file p4.output.

Second, you can see that when we cat the output file, all the expected output 
from running wc found.
