Write a program that creates two children, and connects the standard output of 
one to the standard input of the other, using the pipe() system call.

[ ] gcc 14_hw.c -o 14_hw
[ ] ./14_hw 
Parent process(pid : 41088)  I will create a pipe and will use it in parent and child processes
Child process(pid : 41089). I will use fd[1] to write to the pipe.
Parent process(pid : 41088). I will use fd[0] to read from the pipe.
Message got from child process : MESSAGE_FROM_CHILD
