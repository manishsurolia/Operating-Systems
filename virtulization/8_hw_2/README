Write a program that opens a file(with the open() system call) and then calls 
fork() to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file 
descriptor returned by open()? What happens when they are writing to the file 
concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

[ ] gcc 8_hw.c -o 8_hw


the output is written the file output.txt.

Yes, both parent and child are able to use the same file descriptor initiated 
before fork().

Both are able to write data to the same file concurrently.

output:
=======
[ ] ./8_hw

[ ] cat output.txt
