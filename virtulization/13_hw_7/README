Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child
closes standard output (STDOUT FILENO). What happens if the child
calls printf() to print some output after closing the descriptor?


[ ] gcc 13_hw.c -o 13_hw
[ ] ./13_hw 
Hello, I am parent process. See child has closed the default output file descriptor(STDOUT_FILENO), now its printf is not working


Result : If you close STDOUT_FILENO, then you can not print on the stdout.
