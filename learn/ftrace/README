ftrace: Function Tracer in the Linux Kernel
-------------------------------------------

Definition
----------

'ftrace' is a powerful tracing framework in the Linux kernel,
primarily used for debugging and performance analysis. It allows developers and
system administrators to trace function calls, events, and kernel activities,
helping diagnose issues or optimize performance.

Key Features of ftrace
----------------------

(1) Function Tracing:
    - Trace the entry and exit of kernel functions.
    - Understand the flow of execution within the kernel.

(2) Event Tracing:
    - Trace specific kernel events, such as scheduling, interrupts, or system
      calls.

(3) Custom Filters:
    - Trace only specific functions or events using filters (e.g., by function
      name or process).

(4) Dynamic Tracing:

    - Dynamically enable/disable tracing at runtime without recompiling the
      kernel.

(5) Trace Buffers:

    - Records traces into an in-memory buffer for easy retrieval and analysis.

(6) Multiple Tracers:
    - Includes various tracers like function, sched, irq, and nop (no operation,
      used to disable).

How ftrace Works
----------------

'ftrace' operates by inserting small hooks into the kernel functions or events
you want to trace. These hooks record information (such as timestamps,
CPU states, and call parameters) into a trace buffer. The data can then be
analyzed to understand system behavior.

Key Components of ftrace
------------------------

1. Tracing Directory (/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/):

    The main interface for ftrace. It contains files and directories for
    configuration and accessing trace data.

    Examples:

        - current_tracer: Set the active tracer (e.g., function, sched).
        - trace: View the current trace buffer.
        - trace_pipe: Stream live trace data.
        - available_tracers: List available tracers.

2. Tracers:

    function: Trace function calls in the kernel.
    function_graph: Visualize function call flow with entry/exit.
    sched: Trace scheduling events.
    irqsoff: Detect long interrupt disabling times.
    nop: No operation tracer (used to disable tracing).

3. Filters:

    Focus on specific functions, processes, or events using filters like
    'set_ftrace_filter' or 'set_event_filter'.

Using ftrace
------------

1. Enable Debugfs:

    - Ensure debugfs is mounted:
        sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
        cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/

2. Set a Tracer:
    - To trace all kernel function calls
        echo function > current_tracer

3. Start Tracing:
    - Enable tracing:
        echo 1 > tracing_on

4. View Trace Data:
    - Read the trace log
        cat trace

5. Stop Tracing:
    - Disable tracing
        echo 0 > tracing_on

6. Clear the existing trace data
    - Clear tracing logs
        echo 'nop' > current_tracer

Common Use Cases
----------------

1. Debugging Kernel Functions:
    - Identify where and how kernel functions are being executed.

2. Performance Profiling:
    - Measure latencies and identify bottlenecks in kernel execution.

3. Interrupt and Scheduling Analysis:
    - Analyze scheduling delays, interrupt latencies, and context switches.

4. Testing New Kernel Features:
    - Verify the behavior of new or modified kernel code.

Advantages of ftrace
--------------------

    - Built directly into the Linux kernel.
    - Low overhead compared to other tracing tools.
    - Highly configurable and powerful for a wide range of use cases.

Limitations
-----------

    - Requires root privileges to access.
    - Can be complex to configure for new users.
    - May not provide detailed user-space insights (tools like strace or perf
      are better for that).
