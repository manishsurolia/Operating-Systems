This example, just creates a process, which allocates some Memory(500Mb), and we
check the 'free' command of linux to see how to much RAM and swap memory is used
for this process.

This program 'memory-user.c' allocates 900Mb of memory dynamically and
continuously updates all its space.

Start this program and check the command 'free' in other window.

Before starting the program (./a.out)
-------------------------------------
[ ] free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          980Mi       125Mi       804Mi       0.0Ki        51Mi       760Mi
Swap:         1.0Gi       315Mi       708Mi

After starting the program (./a.out)
------------------------------------
[ ] free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          980Mi       876Mi        68Mi       0.0Ki        35Mi        17Mi
Swap:         1.0Gi       422Mi       601Mi

There is a clear increment in the used RAM as well as in the swap memory.

Current swapiness of the system is 10.
