Below are dictionary meaning of fragment and fragmentation.

Fragment : A small part broken off or separated from something.
Fragmentation : The process or state of breaking or being broken into fragments.

In Operating systems, we have the concept of virtual memory, where compiler
write a program assuming that it is going to be written at address 0x0 and OS
has flexibility to put this process at any place in the main memory.

There are majorly below two ways by which OS achieve this.
(1) segmentation - It cause external fragmentation.
(2) Paging - It cause internal fragmentation.

Lets see both of them one by one to understand how each way of 'achieving
virtual memory' cause fragmentations. 

===============================================================================

Segmentation : Each program is divided in contiguous sections(called segments),
------------   like code segment, data segment, stack and heap segment etc., and
               loaded at different places in the RAM.

We can think of this as how 'malloc' allocates memory in heap region of each
process. There is a free list maintained by the OS to keep record of each free
space in the memory and when malloc is done to get contigious memory for any
segment, OS goes through the free list and try to find suitable contigious
memory to load the segment.

Let's see an example,

Suppose a program(P1) is already loaded in the memory as below (in our small
RAM of 64KB) :

   0KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |                              |
        |                              |
        |      Operating System        |
        |                              |
        |                              |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 16 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |     (Not in Use)             |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 24 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |    P1's Code segment         |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 32 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |     (Not in Use)             |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 40 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |    P1's Data segment         |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 48 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |     (Not in Use)             |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 56 KB  --------------------------------
        |                              |
        |    P1's (heap/stack segment) |
        |                              |
        |                              |
 64 KB  --------------------------------


Here, suppose at this point, another process (P2) want to gets loaded in RAM,
which has a code segment of 10KB. Even though we have total 24KB of free space
in the RAM, but all this 24 KB is fragmented. We can not load the process P2's
code in the memory in current situation. If this 24 KB was all together we
could have used it for process P2.

For segmentation technique, all the free spaces in RAM are maintained in a free
list by OS (same as 'malloc' used for heap) and to make all this memory
together, OS will need to 'coalesce' the free memory like what 'free' call does
in case of heap.

But this 'coalescing' is a costly operation, as we need to reshuffle the
positions of many processes segments which will consume lots of CPU time. This
problem of fragmentation is called "External fragmentation". It happens with
segmentation technique of process allocation in RAM.

External Fragmentation : This problem of having small chunk of memories at
----------------------   differnet places in RAM, is called
                         "External fragmentation". This type of fragmentation
                         is caused by 'segmentation'.
